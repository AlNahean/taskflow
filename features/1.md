Of course. You've built a very solid foundation for a modern task management application. The architecture is clean, it uses a great tech stack, and the UI is consistent. To improve upon it, we can focus on several key areas: **User Experience (UX)**, **Deeper Functionality**, and **Code/Performance Optimizations**.

Here is a comprehensive guide on how you can enhance the application, structured from quick wins to more advanced features.

### Tier 1: High-Impact UX & UI Enhancements

These changes will make the app feel more responsive and professional with relatively low effort.

#### 1. Implement Real-Time Filtering

- **Current State:** The task filters require a user to select options and then click an "Apply Filters" button.
- **Suggestion:** Remove the "Apply Filters" and "Reset" buttons. Instead, trigger the `onFiltersChange` callback immediately whenever a filter value changes (e.g., inside the `toggleStatus`, `togglePriority` functions, and in the `onChange` of the search input).
- **Benefit:** The task list will update instantly as the user interacts with the filters, providing a much smoother and more modern user experience.

**Example for `task-filters.tsx`:**

```tsx
// Inside TaskFilters component

const handleFilterChange = React.useCallback(() => {
  onFiltersChange({
    search: search || undefined,
    status: selectedStatus.length > 0 ? selectedStatus : undefined,
    priority: selectedPriority.length > 0 ? selectedPriority : undefined,
    category: selectedCategory.length > 0 ? selectedCategory : undefined,
  });
}, [
  search,
  selectedStatus,
  selectedPriority,
  selectedCategory,
  onFiltersChange,
]);

// Apply filters automatically on change
React.useEffect(() => {
  handleFilterChange();
}, [handleFilterChange]);

// Remove the "Apply Filters" button and its handler
```

#### 2. Create a Global "Add Task" Button

- **Current State:** The "New Task" button only exists on the `/tasks` page.
- **Suggestion:** Create a global "Add Task" button (perhaps a floating action button or a button in a main header) that is visible on most pages. This button would open the same `TaskFormModal`. You can manage its state with a simple React Context or a layout-level state.
- **Benefit:** Users can add a task from anywhere in the app without needing to navigate away from their current view, which is a core feature of productivity apps.

#### 3. More Engaging Empty States

- **Current State:** Empty states say "No tasks found".
- **Suggestion:** Use your existing `Empty.tsx` component to create more visually appealing empty states. Include an icon, a clear message, and a call-to-action.
- **Benefit:** Improves the user experience when there's no data, guiding them on what to do next.

**Example for `today-tasks.tsx`:**

```tsx
import {
  Empty,
  EmptyMedia,
  EmptyTitle,
  EmptyDescription,
} from "@/components/ui/empty";
import { Plus } from "lucide-react";
// ...
if (todayTasks.length === 0) {
  return (
    <Card className="rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center h-full">
      <Empty>
        <EmptyMedia variant="icon">
          <CheckCircle2 />
        </EmptyMedia>
        <EmptyTitle>All Clear for Today!</EmptyTitle>
        <EmptyDescription>
          You have no tasks due today. Enjoy your day or add a new task.
        </EmptyDescription>
      </Empty>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Tier 2: Core Functionality Upgrades

These features will make your application significantly more powerful and competitive.

#### 1. Implement a "Board View" with Drag-and-Drop

- **Current State:** Tasks are only viewable in a table/list format.
- **Suggestion:** Add a "Board" view on the `/tasks` page, similar to Trello. Create columns for each status (`todo`, `in_progress`, etc.). Users could then drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status. Libraries like `react-beautiful-dnd` or `dnd-kit` are excellent for this.
- **Benefit:** This is a highly intuitive and popular way to manage workflows, making your app much more versatile.

### Tier 3: Code Quality, Performance & Advanced Features

These are architectural improvements that will make your app more robust, scalable, and faster.

#### 1. Leverage React Server Components (RSC)

- **Current State:** Most of your page components (`dashboard-page.tsx`, `tasks-page.tsx`) are client components (`"use client"`). This means data is fetched on the client after the page loads.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor your pages to be Server Components by default. Fetch initial data directly on the server and pass it as props to client components.

  **Example refactor for `app/tasks/page.tsx`:**

  ```tsx
  import { TasksPageContent } from "@/components/pages/tasks-page";
  import prisma from "@/lib/prisma";

  // This is now a Server Component
  export default async function TasksPage() {
    // 1. Fetch data on the server
    const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
      orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" },
    });

    // 2. Pass it as props to the client component that handles interactivity
    return <TasksPageContent initialTasks={tasks} />;
  }
  ```

  You would then modify `TasksPageContent` to accept `initialTasks` and adjust the `useTasks` hook to use this initial data instead of fetching it again on load.

- **Benefit:** Dramatically improves initial page load performance, reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, and is the idiomatic way to build apps with the Next.js App Router.

#### 2. Implement API Pagination

- **Current State:** The `GET /api/tasks` endpoint returns all tasks. With 100+ tasks, this is manageable, but with thousands, it will become very slow.
- **Suggestion:** Modify the API endpoint to accept `page` and `limit` query parameters. Update your `useTasks` hook and UI to handle fetching data in pages.

  **`app/api/tasks/route.ts` change:**

  ```typescript
  // ...
  export async function GET(request: Request) {
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
    const page = parseInt(searchParams.get("page") || "1");
    const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get("limit") || "20");
    const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

    const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
      skip: skip,
      take: limit,
      orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" },
    });
    // Also fetch total count for pagination UI
    const total = await prisma.task.count();
    return NextResponse.json({ tasks, total, page, limit });
  }
  // ...
  ```

- **Benefit:** Ensures your application remains fast and scalable as the amount of data grows.
